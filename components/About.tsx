        Welcome! My name is Wyatt Connolly, I am a self-taught developer and web
        designer <br /> Starting from no-code in January of 2020 I became
        obsessed with the world of programming. Poring through resources such as
        The Odin Project, LeetCode, and Codecademy I have been developing the
        necessary skills for becoming a full stack developer.
        <br /> &gt;Let&apos;s work together!
